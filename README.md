This repo is for generative art with PostScript output that can be printed
to standard 3 1/8 inch (80 mm) thermal receipt paper. I personally use [this 
Rongta point-of-sale (POS) printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08V4H7T47/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to print my artwork. For example,
here is the same banner above printed out:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="Banner, printed" src="figures/banner_printed.jpg" style="width:500px;" />
</div>

I like to make my art at art trading card size (2.5 x 3.5 in), so this code is
designed around that. This size is conveniently just a little bit narrower
than the paper, so it pairs well.

I jokingly refer to my receipt printer as a "paper toaster" since a thermal
printer works by heating the thermal paper, darkening it. No ink is used.

## Dependencies

[GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) must be installed for PDF and PNG exports to work

## Usage

```bash
# Generate the postscript file in output/<artwork_id>.ps
# see -h for options. 
python main.py [global_options] <artwork_id> -- [artwork_options]
```

The output documents are written to `output/<artwork_id>_*`. This includes:

* `<artwork_id>.ps` - The PostScript file generated by the script
* `<artwork_id>.pdf` - (Requires GhostScript) a PDF version of the document. I find this to be the easiest to use for printing
* `<artwork_id>_print.png` - (Requires GhostScript) a PNG preview version at 300 DPI. This size is usable for printing, though the PDF version 
* `<artwork_id>_web.png` - (Requires GhostScript) a PNG version at 200 DPI. I use this to make larger screenshots for my website.
* `<artwork_id>_thumbnail.png` - (Requires GhostScript) a PNG version at 100 DPI. I use this for thumbnails in the README and on my website.

### Global Options

There are a few options that can be used with any artwork to control the page
size and layout. However, some artworks may be designed for specific
configurations, such as one trading-card sized page.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--num-cards N` | How many 2.5x3.5 inch trading cards tall will the receipt be. For example, I often print receipts 
| `--page-width WIDTH_INCHES` | Override the width of the page to be any size in inches |
| `--page-height HEIGHT_INCHES` | Override the height of the page to be any size in inches |
| `--landscape` | Make the ouput document landscape rather than portrait |

### Edge Direction Tiling (2022-09-03)

This tiling was an artistic way of visualizing flow in a grid.

First, a grid of cells is created. Then, for each edge between cells, a
direction across the edge is chosen randomly. Then, for each cell, based
on which directions the flow in/out of the tile is going, one of several
tiles is chosen. 

Randomly placing the tiles would be an easier implementation, but this method
ensures that if you follow any path from a source (closed circle) to a sink
(open circle), the flow direction will look consistent.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `-s/--square-size SQUARE_SIZE` | The size of each grid square. Defaults to 1/4 inch |

**Examples:**

| Example | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ![Edge direction tiling](figures/edge_directions_simple.png) | `main.py edge_directions` | Simple example |
| ![Edge direction tiling with smaller squares](figures/edge_directions_dense.png) | `main.py edge_directions -s 0.125` | Set the square size to 1/8 of an inch |

### Iso Grid (2022-07-24)

I've always liked the look of isometric grids in video games and art, so this
artwork makes a mountain-like scene on an isometric grid.

The scene is an illusion. I'm just overlaying a bunch of solid-color
parallelograms from back to front to make the scene. This is somewhat inspired
by 2D tile-based iso rendering, but much simpler to implement. Of course, it
only works well for this carefully curated scene.

To make the mountain shape, I randomly generate heights in each cell such that
a cell is equal or taller than any of its neighbors closer to the "camera".

**Parameters:**

This script generates a random isometric scene each time. There are no
parameters.

**Examples:**

| Example | Command |
|---|---|
| ![Iso grid example 1](figures/iso_grid_example1.png) | `main.py iso_grid` |
| ![Iso grid example 2](figures/iso_grid_example2.png) | `main.py iso_grid` |

### Quiet Dice (2022-06-20)

Sometimes I want a large number of dice rolls (e.g. for drawing dice-generated
art on paper), but rolling that many dice would be inconvenient (because it
would be tedious, noisy, or I don't have dice on hand).

Certainly it's easy to find apps to do dice rolls, but sometimes I want to get
away from my phone. So it would be handy to roll many dice up front, then
cross off entries from the list as I use them.

This script simply generates a bunch of dice rolls of the form (NdX + M) in
[standard dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation#Standard_notation)
and prints them out in a table.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `N` | (required) How many dice are summed for each roll. For example, 2 would mean roll two dice and add their results |
| `SIDES` | (required) Each die rolled will have this many sides. |
| `-m/--modifier MODIFIER` | A constant value to add to the result. |

**Examples:**

| Example | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ![1d6](figures/quiet_dice_1d6.png) | `main.py quiet_dice 1 6` | Simple example |
| ![2d10](figures/quiet_dice_2d10.png) | `main.py quiet_dice 2 10` | Example where each roll adds two 10-sided dice. |
| ![1d20 + 2](figures/quiet_dice_1d20_2.png) | `main.py quiet_dice 1 20 -m 2` | Example with a modifier |

### Hitomezashi (2022-06-17)

This artwork is based on Hitomezashi embroidery patterns, inspired by
[this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbfhzlMk2eY). Hitomezashi
is a form of [Sashiko embroidery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashiko),
decorative running stitch patterns that help reinforce clothing.

This script lets you specify two integers to set the bit pattern for the
rows and columns (see the video to see how this works). Large numbers with
a variety of 1s and 0s work best.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `ROW_BITS` | An integer representing the bits for the rows (least significant bit first). It can be a decimal number or a binary number prefixed with `0b`. Rows are numbered from bottom to top of the document. |
| `COL_BITS` | An integer representing the bits for the columns (least significant bit first). It can be a decimal number or a binary number prefixed with `0b`. Columns are numbered from left to right. |
| `-o/--odd-even` | If true, the pattern is filled with an odd/even coloring. |
| `-s/--square-size` | Size of each square in inches. Defaults to a quarter of an inch |

**Examples:**

| Example | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ![hitomezashi: simplest example](figures/hitomezashi_simplest.png) | `main.py hitomezashi 0 0` | The simplest possible example. Since all the bits are zero, you get a repeated pattern of squares. Note that the bottom left corner has a stitch in both directions
| ![hitomezashi: shift some columns](figures/hitomezashi_shift_columns.png) | `main.py hitomezashi 0 0b1111000` | Since bits are read LSB-first, this shifts columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 |
| ![hitomezashi: shift rows and columns](figures/hitomezashi_shift_both.png) | `main.py hitomezashi 123456 101010` | Here I'm just typing patterns in decimal, the actual binary strings are different |
| ![hitomezashi: odd-even coloring](figures/hitomezashi_odd_even.png) | `main.py hitomezashi -o 123456 101010` | Same as the previous example, but with odd-even coloring turned on |
| ![hitomezashi: dense grid](figures/hitomezashi_dense.png) | `main.py hitomezashi -s 0.125 12345678910 0b11001100110011001100` | Set the square size smaller. Note that I needed to use larger numbers to have enough bits | 
| ![hitomezashi: dice-generated experiment](figures/hitomezashi_dice.png) | `main.py hitomezashi -s 0.125 -o 465665232252 252232566564| :test_tube: I rolled 12d6 to pick the digits, but entered it in reverse order for the columns |
| ![hitomezashi: bit pattern experiment](figures/hitomezashi_bit_patterns.png) | `main.py hitomezashi -o -s 0.125 0b10110111011110111110111110 0b010010101111010100100` | :test_tube: The digits for the rows are 10, 110, 1110, 11110 concatenated. The column digits are a pattern with mirror symmetry. |
| ![hitomezashi: stripes](figures/hitomezashi_stripes.png) | `main.py hitomezashi -o 0b10101010101010101010 0b010101010101` | :test_tube: alternating bits produces a stair-step pattern. Changing the final bit reverses the pattern in each direction |

### Hex Grid (2022-06-15)

Hex grid with some optional gaps between hexagons. It also can render dots
instead of lines.

This artwork only supports a single card-length receipt.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `-s/--side-length SIDE_LENGTH` | The side length of each hexagon in inches. Defaults to 1/4 inch |
| `-e/--expand-factor EXPAND_FACTOR` | How much to expand/contract the grid for artistic effect |
| `-d/--dots` | Draw the hexagon vertices, but do not connect them. This can be used to make a hex grid  |

**Examples:**

| Example | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ![Default hex grid](figures/hex_grid_default.png) | `main.py hex_grid` | Default settings |
| ![Hex grid with gaps](figures/hex_grid_gaps.png) | `main.py hex_grid -e 1.2` | Increase the expand factor to create gaps between the hexagons |
| ![Hex grid dots](figures/hex_grid_dots.png) | `main.py hex_grid --dots` | Just render a hexagon grid with just dots|
| ![Experiment: overlap](figures/hex_grid_overlap.png) | `main.py hex_grid -e 0.8` | :test_tube: Decrease the expand factor to make the hexagons overlap for neat effect |
| ![Experiment: contracted dots](figures/hex_grid_contracted_dots.png) | `main.py hex_grid --dots -e 0.8` | :test_tube: Turn on dots, but also contract the hexagons like the overlap case |

### Grid (2022-06-15)

This was a warm-up exercise, this makes a card with graph paper.

**Parameters:**
